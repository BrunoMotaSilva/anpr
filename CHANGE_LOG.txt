1. Added the ability to use c:\ on vista for the DVRSTORAGE directory. Since Vista does
not allow the user to add files to the root of c:\, it is not required to add a file
called firstevidencedrive.txt when using c:\.  Instead, drivemanager just looks
for the folder DVRSTORAGE if the drive is c:. Otherwise, for other drives, the behavoir
has not changed.

2. in Plate Analysts workstation, when using batch mode processing of jpegs, if 
no longer create a sub directory for each jpeg being stored to a user specified storage folder.

3. in Plate Analysts workstation, when using batch mode processing of jpegs, the jpeg player
in the FrameGenerator could send the jpegs faster than LPR could process, causing buffer overruns.
So I put in a feedback mechenism to slow down the jpeg source when the LPRProcessQ hits the 1/2 mark.

4. in Plate Analysts workstation, added feature to delete search result table rows, edit the row plate number,
and export the table (with edited results).

5. fixed a problem detected with time stamps on jpeg batch processing. Now using the time stamp from
the source file rather than DateTime.Now.

6.  fixed analysts workstation export bug - frames were being dropped in the queue m_NewFramesToPushQ due
to a Q limit of 60 frames. Increased to 240 frames. This queue receives frames from the directshow decode
of a video file.  A seperate thread de-queues from this queue to push to the LPR and DVR processors. This queue
is in the path of batch processing a recorded video files.




-------------- 10 November 2009

7. fix eventlog.txt bug that LATIN does not show up if from batch mode jpeg processing.
